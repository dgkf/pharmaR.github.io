Metric	Reason for Inclusion
Vignette	It is good practice to provide additional help documentation for a package in the form of one or more vignettes. 
Website	"It is good practice to maintain a website with further information about the package, contact details, and other supporting information."
Source control (public)	The use of source control is good practice that facilitates development.  In general it will not be possible to determine whether the maintainer is using a source code repository unless this is in the public domain. 
Formal bug tracking	"Bugs can be logged by emails, but the better practice is to provide a formal mechanism for bug tracking."
News	"A news feed is good practice as it makes users aware of updates to the package, thereby highlighting the areas of greatest risk."
Release rate (18 months)	"A stable but continuing release pattern is a sign of active maintenance.  Active maintenance reduces the risk of bugs/errors and so a higher frequency indicates a reduced risk.  However, it should be noted that as a package stabilises over time, the release rate may slow.  When interpreting this metric it is therefore also important to consider the package maturity."
Number of dependencies	"Reusing code means less new code and hence less potential for error.  The higher the number of dependencies, the lower the risk."
