* Delivering Software Programs

> "Sponsors should provide the software programs used to create all ADaM datasets and
generate tables and figures associated with primary and secondary efficacy analyses.
Furthermore, sponsors should submit software programs used to generate additional
information included in Section 14 CLINICAL STUDIES of the Prescribing Information
(PI)26 if applicable. The specific software utilized should be specified in the ADRG. The
main purpose of requesting the submission of these programs is to understand the process
by which the variables for the respective analyses were created and to confirm the
analysis algorithms. Sponsors should submit software programs in ASCII text format;
however, executable file extensions should not be used."
