## R Foundation

In March 2018, the R Foundation re-released a document entitle [R: Regulatory Compliance and Validation Issues A Guidance Document for the Use of R in Regulated Clinical Trial Environments](https://www.r-project.org/doc/R-FDA.pdf).  This document describes the R Foundation's response to ICH and FDA guidelines with regards to the 'Base' and 'Recommended' R packages.

Accompanying the guidance document the R Foundation have also released details of the R Development Core Team's [Software Development Lifecycle](https://www.r-project.org/doc/R-SDLC.pdf).

## FDA

As described in the R Foundation's guidance document, there are several import documents / statements available form the FDA:

* [Statistical Software Clarifying Statement](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/forindustry/datastandards/studydatastandards/ucm587506.pdf)
* [Statistical Computing Challenges @ FDA](http://www.copafs.org/UserFiles/file/2016FCSM/6_4_Final_Schuette.pdf)
* Delivering Software Programs

> "Sponsors should provide the software programs used to create all ADaM datasets and
generate tables and figures associated with primary and secondary efficacy analyses.
Furthermore, sponsors should submit software programs used to generate additional
information included in Section 14 CLINICAL STUDIES of the Prescribing Information
(PI)26 if applicable. The specific software utilized should be specified in the ADRG. The
main purpose of requesting the submission of these programs is to understand the process
by which the variables for the respective analyses were created and to confirm the
analysis algorithms. Sponsors should submit software programs in ASCII text format;
however, executable file extensions should not be used."
